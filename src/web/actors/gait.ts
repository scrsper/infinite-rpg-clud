/**
 * Human gait curves for the procedural animator.
 *
 * Joint angles over one gait cycle for walking and running, taken as smooth approximations of
 * normative sagittal-plane gait data (hip flexion, knee flexion, foot pitch to the ground) and
 * the pelvis/trunk motions that accompany them. A cycle starts at heel strike (walk) or foot
 * strike (run) of the leg it describes; the other leg runs half a cycle later. Walking has a long
 * stance (toe-off near 60%) with a small loading knee bend and a large swing bend; running has a
 * short stance (toe-off near 38%), a deeper loaded knee and a flight phase.
 *
 * Presentation only: nothing here reads or changes canonical state.
